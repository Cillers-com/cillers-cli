<task>
    Create a new command 'init-coder' that creates a template-based .cillers/context directory in the currwent working directory, if it doesn't already exist. The template should contain the same files and content as the current .cillers/context in this project. The content templates should be coded as multiline strings so they will be embedded in the binary. Create a new directory in this project called coder/templates/context. Create one Go file per file that should be created by the 'init-coder' command.
